# NITT-HACKATHON-FACE-MASK-DETECTION-SYSTEM


## This system focuses on integrating the real time face mask detection with the CCTV available in major places to detect the absence of masks since prevention is always better than cure

### For protection and prevention against Covid 19 and other infectious diseases
Wearing a face mask has become an indispensable part of our lives, ever since the coronavirus came 
into existence. During the pandemic, masks played a critical role in preventing transmission of the 
virus and hence were very widely used. However, because the concept of wearing masks on such a 
regular basis was completely new to the masses, it has been difficult to implement the practice 
effectively. Face masks are often not worn properly, rendering them useless and hence it becomes 
imperative that there is some mechanism to check the same, preferably without human intervention as 
there is already shortage of personnel in several areas. In such a situation, an automated Face Mask 
Detection System comes in vary handy.

### For protecting the workers against the harmful nuclear radiation
Many workers die due to the direct contact of the nuclear radiation and hence masks are an absolute essential for the workers who are regular contact with nuclear radiation suuvh as factories and mines.

### For protecting doctors and nurses against infectious diseases
Many doctors are in regular contact with patients who are infected and hence mask plays a major role in helping the doctors and nurses to stay safe.

## IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT

This mask recognition system was created by using python libraries and machine learning model in Jupyter Notebook,also by implementing basic skills learned for pre-processing of data science tools.
