# NITT-HACKATHON-FACE-MASK-DETECTION-SYSTEM
Wearing a face mask has become an indispensable part of our lives, ever since the coronavirus came 
into existence. During the pandemic, masks played a critical role in preventing transmission of the 
virus and hence were very widely used. However, because the concept of wearing masks on such a 
regular basis was completely new to the masses, it has been difficult to implement the practice 
effectively. Face masks are often not worn properly, rendering them useless and hence it becomes 
imperative that there is some mechanism to check the same, preferably without human intervention as 
there is already shortage of personnel in several areas. In such a situation, an automated Face Mask 
Detection System comes in vary handy.

#Moreover Masks are an absolute essential for the workers who are regular contact with nuclear radiation.
